# Highlighting

This feature will "highlight" (typically with markup) the terms that matched the query, including a snippet of the text around the matched term. 

To enable highlighting please include a HighlightingParameters QueryOptions object where you include which fields you want to apply highlighting to.

Sample code:

```c#
var results = solr.Query(new SolrQueryByField("features", "noise"), new QueryOptions {
    Highlight = new HighlightingParameters {
        Fields = new[] {"features"},
    }
});
foreach (var h in results.Highlights[results[0].Id]) {
    Console.WriteLine("{0}: {1}", h.Key, string.Join(", ", h.Value.ToArray()));
}
```
would print for example:

```
features: <em>Noise</em>Guard, SilentSeek technology, Fluid Dynamic Bearing (FDB) motor
```

If you need to specify additional parameters, for example the snippet size for a specific field, it is necessary to do so using ExtraParams which then are added to the QueryOptions object of your query. 
```
Dictionary<string, string> extraParams = new Dictionary<string, string>();
extraParams.Add("f.features.hl.fragsize", "250");
```

The results object will include:
- A Highlights property which is an IDictionary<string, SolrNet.Impl.HighlightedSnippets>. 
- The string corresponds to the document uniquekey
- The HighlightedSnippets is an IDictionary<string, ICollection<string>>. This object indicates which field is being returned, for example "features" and the snppet text "<em>Noise</em>Guard, SilentSeek technology, Fluid Dynamic Bearing (FDB) motor" 


The returned tag corresponds to <em> although it can be configured directly in Solr to use a different tag. Also, if the request handler in Solr is configured to include highlights, it is not required to add the query options.

This is the second change that I do in new documentation
